Design journal for interaction design fundamentals

Week 1 
------
On our first week we learned about [Refresh](http://refreshbelfast.com) and [Break conference](http://breakconf.org) which are talks being held in belfast that we are all invited too. 

This week we learned the importance of starting on paper and developing ideas. We done a two day work shop were we were placed into groups to develope an idea based around the theme of space. I loved working as team and gave me an oppertunity to get to know other people in my class as I didn't know anyone when I started. 
I loved the new techniques on ideas generation that we learned as it taught me different ways to develope my ideas myself and as a group.
